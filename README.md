This project is an algorithm that finds the best case placements for Wublins on Wublin island in the game "My Singing Monsters". If you don't know how Wublins work, here's a quick rundown: Wublins are creatures that have a like/dislike system called "polarity"
based on who is nearby them. Wublins are more productive with someone they like and less productive near someone they hate. This algorithm searches for the best layouts on the Wublin island map to maximize 'like' relationships and minimize dislikes. The current plan is to
store all of these layouts on a website and let the user filter through all these layouts to find the design they like most to use in their own game. User's will be able to run the algorithm themselves as this project is open source.
